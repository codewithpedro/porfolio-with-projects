## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

A few things I learn were using the useEffect for fetching the API, storing into local storage, and creating a Movie componment to display movie's info (picture, plot summary, rating, ect).

### Continued development

Next is to develope a netflix style movie list. The movie's information will be hidden until the user hovers or focuses an element to show the information.
