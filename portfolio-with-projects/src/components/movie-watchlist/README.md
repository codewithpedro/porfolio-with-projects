## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- Be able to toggle from dark and light mode
- Search keywords to find a list of movies based on the keywords.
- Save a movie into a list locally saved on their local storage.
- Remove a movie from thier local saved list by click on mywatch list.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

A few things I learn were using the useEffect for fetching the API, storing into local storage, and creating a Movie componment to display movie's info (picture, plot summary, rating, ect).

### Continued development

Next is to develop a netflix style movie list. The movie's information will be hidden until the user hovers or focuses an element to show the information.
